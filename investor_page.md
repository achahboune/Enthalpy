## 🌍 The Vision: Securing the Global Supply Chain

> **At Enthalpy, our mission is to eliminate waste and ensure product integrity in the perishable goods supply chain.**
> The current standard of passive data logging is no longer sufficient. Businesses need **real-time visibility** to prevent costly spoilage, and consumers deserve products that are safe and effective.
> We are building the technology to make this a reality.

## 🎯 Why We Are Raising a Pre-Seed Round

We have a clear vision, a robust technical architecture, and a detailed MVP plan. This round is about **execution**, not discovery.

Funds will be strategically allocated to produce the **first 10 commercial-grade IoT sensor kits** — the critical tools for our field trials with pilot partners.

## Visual & Formatting Tips for Notion

* Use **callout blocks** for the Vision and Ask sections to grab attention (use `/callout`).
* Add relevant **icons/emojis** (I added some examples) to break the monotony.
* Use **toggle blocks** for details in the Allocation section if you want to keep the page concise but expandable.
* Insert **dividers** (`---`) between sections for clean separation.
* Add a **Table** block for fund allocation to enhance clarity.
* Include **bold** and *italic* to emphasize important points.
* Optionally, insert your **logo** at the top by dragging an image into Notion.
* Use **color backgrounds** for callouts in Notion for key points (click the three dots on the block > Color > Background).
